# Arya

**Arya** is an evolving language with simplicity and expressive power that offer a robust means of performing a variety of programming tasks. Built on Python, Arya is designed with procedural programming in mind, and integrates intuitive syntax and a straightforward approach to make programming more accessible and efficient. **Arya currently only supports the production of simple scripts.**

# Language Paradigm

Arya is grounded in the **Procedural** programming paradigm, allowing developers to write code in a clear and organized manner. This paradigm supports a step-by-step approach to solving problems, enhancing both readability and maintainability.

# Language Classification

- **Type:** General Purpose
- **Level:** High-Level

As a high-level language, Arya abstracts away complex machine-level operations and provides a structure that is easy to understand and use. It is capable of addressing a wide range of computational problems, making it a versatile tool for various programming tasks.

## Key Characteristics

### Simplicity
Arya emphasizes simplicity, which enhances readability, writability, and reliability. The language incorporates natural language elements into its syntax, such as intuitive keywords and clear structure, reducing the learning curve and making the code easier to understand. For example, loop constructs use words like “limit” and “ascend” to make the purpose of the loop more apparent.

### Syntax Design
Arya's syntax is inspired by Python, featuring a clean and minimalistic design. With a limited set of keywords and straightforward syntax rules, Arya is designed to be easily understood and written.

### Expressivity
Arya is designed to express complex ideas and solutions in a clear and concise manner. Its intuitive syntax allows developers to articulate their thoughts effectively, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

### Type Checking
Arya enforces strict type checking to ensure data integrity and prevent runtime errors. By validating types during development, Arya helps catch errors early and enhances code reliability. Type annotations provide clarity, making it easier to understand and manage code.

### Data Types
Arya supports a range of data types that contribute to clarity and type safety. The language enforces strong typing to ensure that variables maintain their declared types throughout the program, which helps in preventing type-related errors. Supported data types include:
- **Integer:** Declared using the `integer` keyword (e.g., 0, 25, 1000).
- **Float:** Declared using the `float` keyword (e.g., 2.883, 1.35).
- **String:** Declared using the `string` keyword and enclosed in double quotes (e.g., “Hello world!”).
- **Boolean:** Declared using the `boolean` keyword with values `True` or `False`.

### Language Constructs
Arya includes a variety of language constructs that enable developers to write clear, concise, and effective code. These constructs support various programming paradigms and control flow mechanisms, contributing to the overall flexibility and robustness of the language. Here is an overview of the main language constructs supported by Arya:
- **Variable declaration & assignment:** Variables are declared with a specific data type using the integer, float, string, or boolean keywords. Variable declarations ensure that each variable is assigned a type at the time of creation. Values can also to previously declared variables, and the language is designed to ensure that the values assigned are compatible with the variable's type.
- **Arrays:** Arrays store multiple values of the same data type. Arrays are declared with specific data types and sizes. Access elements within an array using indices. This construct allows for retrieving or modifying array elements.
- **while loops:** Loops that execute as long as a specified condition is true. This construct facilitates repetitive tasks and iterative processing.
- **for loops:** These are a more versatile looping construct that supports initialization, condition checking, and iteration in a single line.
- **if statements:** Conditional execution of code blocks based on boolean expressions. The if statement supports additional else if (otherwise being Arya's keyword equivalent to else) and else clauses for multiple conditional branches.
